#Streamline coordinates From a CSV Of addresses
A python script to get Coordinates from a large CSV of addresses Using GoogleMaps

*Lets say you want to get a list of pin-point COORDINATES and all that you have is an extra-super large list of ADDRESSES ONLY
Its a piece of cake*
Make sure you create a CSV (Comma-delimitted file) and populate your list of addresses under a column named address
The Usage Format of the Script on your python terminal is

[addresses-file.csv],[name-of-coordinates-files.csv];

for example the file which contains your addresses is address.csv and you want to put your coordinates in the file called coordinates.csv, you would make use of this script in the following format

>  address.csv,coordinates.csv 

You would require to have python installed on you machine.
